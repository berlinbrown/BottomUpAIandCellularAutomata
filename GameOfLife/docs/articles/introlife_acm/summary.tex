\section{Summary}

Moving forward if we want to study, analyze and work with artificial agents, we
might consider systems that have evolved behavior over a series of steps.  We
might not build a specific tool with a specific purpose but the creature that is
built from the system may produce interesting properties which are unlike the
clean-room created software that we create today.

With this artificial life approach, but we also want to study the simple life
forms first before moving too fast forward like human behavior.
