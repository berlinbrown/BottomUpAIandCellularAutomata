\begin{abstract}
This article presents Botlist-Network (Botlist).  Botlist is a 
web application and information retrieval system that aims to collect
and analyze content from the vast world wide web.  Botlist is an specification
for describing the platform, the Botlist web front end and the Botlist backend
infrastructure for crawling and analyzing web documents and converting those
documents into a machine readable format such as RDF semantic web formats.

This article also looks at the use of several powerful open source programming
languages.  Each language is used for it strenghs.

%% General Structure Notes:
%%
%% In my articles, I will question, what is artificial intelligence?
%%        what is intelligence?  Why is human intelligence more interesting than
%%     animal intelligence?
%%
%% Outline:
%% 1. Overview
%% 2. History of AI and Computing, Turing, VonNue, etc
%%    History with ALife, Langton, GameOfLife
%%
%% Charles Darwin
%% 1937 Alan Turing
%% 1945 John von Neumann
%%
%% 1970 Cellular automaton, John Conway
%% 1986 Christopher Langton
%%
%% 3. Basic biology and concepts
%%     What is DNA?
%%     What is the mitochondira?
%%     What is RNA?
%%     What is life?  Why is it interesting?
%%
%% 4. Modeling the biology
%% 5. Overview of the demo application, object model
%%    DNA
%%
