A long standing challenge to evolutarionary theory has been whether it can
explain the origin of complex organismal features.

- There wasn't any special that scala provided, good expressive syntax

- The brain doesn't have much function outside of the human body, no context
  The brain is a tool
  humans don't have an explicit purpose but our arms, legs do.

As a computational molecular biophysics grad student (i.e. I program and know
biochem), I disagree with this analogy. Human programming is nowhere near the
level of complexity of transcription/translation. Here is my attempt at
comparing programming with DNA:

DNA is the source code. It is transcribed(compiled) to RNA(bytecode), but what
sections and how often is determined by levels, locations, and conformations of
DNA, RNA, and proteins. RNA can inhibit or promote transcription of different
sections, and proteins can do the same, of course dependent on which pieces of
RNA/proteins and at what levels and what location. RNA is compiled to
proteins(machine code) in the same way, with the same parameters. Also, at each
level of code (source code, bytecode, machine code) there is additional
space/time dependent modification, i.e. the source code or machine code now may
differ from the source code or machine code in 2 seconds. For example, DNA has
error-prone copying, can curl up in certain sections and be unavailable for
"compiling", can have proteins/RNA bind to certain sections and stop the
compiler(polymerase) from continuing(like a breakpoint), etc.

So essentially you have a self-modifying source code which generates a ton of
sections of bytecode, all of which can modify the source code, other pieces of
bytecode, and other pieces of machine code, and a bunch of machine code pieces
generated from the all the pieces of bytecode which can modify the source-code,
some of the bytecode, and some of the machine code. The source-code for the
compiler is also included and is created/modified following the above
procedures. Oh ya, and throw in the fact that every modification/compilation is
stochastic and also based on temporal/spatial factors (imagine compilations and
modifications only happen if a compiler bumps into code, and that movement is
dictated by diffusion or assistance by a piece of byte or machine code). That is
biology.

   2. other radiation frequencies, including x-rays and gamma rays
   3. hydrolysis or thermal disruption
   4. certain plant toxins
   5. human-made mutagenic chemicals, especially aromatic compounds that act as DNA intercalating agents

FALSE: - DNA is only analogous to code. 
decode a message
he ordering of the base pairs defines the code
Because decoding goes from DNA to protein, encoding would have to go from protein to DNA.  But that mechanism is not known to exis
Encoding in fact goes from the "soup" made of four bases to DNA.

 surial, clear ;)
<surial> paissad: As long as 1 or more variables point to objects, they'll be in memory.
<surial> if 0 variables point to them, they might still be in memory. Or not. Who cares? JVM makes it all work, its not the kind of thing you need to worry about. Once it makes no possible difference for your running program, no matter WHAT it'll do from this point forward, if that object is still in memory or not, the JVM may at some point remove it to clear up memory.
* NodoLibero has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
<surial> paissad: For all practical intents, objects pointed to by static variables exist for the lifetime of the JVM - i.e. for programming, reason like that. But its not actually true, once you look at the technical side, and especially not if you start looking at the 'how much memory will my app take' side.
<ernimril> if you do webapps or plugin based systems you will need to know the basics of classloaders and statics and how/when unloading can happen

l> (s/both of them/all of them/) correction: paissad: Also, there are literally tens of webapp and plugin frameworks out there. Writing your own is virtually always a horrible plan. The only exception is if you've worked extensively with all of them and found your needs are so spectacularly ill served by every already available solution that starting to build a new one from scratch is a better option than improving what exists and contributing

Different cell levels.

1. Cell wall and flagella level

2. Protein, amino acid, Chemical level <---- what is in this level????
   What is in this level:  chemicals need to maintain the existence of this
                          property.

   Chemical Reaction between radiation of the sun and the protein on this cell

Proteins are the "cellular machinery"; they are constantly being synthesized, 
and play many essential structural and enzymatic roles within the cell.

--- HOW DOES A CELL DIE? protein sythensis is interrupted.

seasons --- more radiaton 

What should the DNA control?

size --- how much protein is created.

grid is actually chemicals, proteins.  we can't change the chemical elements.

should we be able to change the properties of the proteins?

More cell wall protein, less energy to perform that function.

There are several hundred distinct human cell types [1], [2][3]. 
There are between 50 and 75 trillion cells in the human body.

What is a protein?  What is an amino acide?

20 standard amino acids; 

-- Cell wall
-- Chromosome
-- Plasma membrane
-- Fibrils
-- Ribosomes

Protein

The most elaborate viruses are the bacteriophages
Viruses also carry genes for making proteins that are never incorporated into the 
virus particle and are found only in infected cells. These viral proteins are 
called non-structural proteins; they include factors required for the replication 
of the viral genome and the production of the virus particle.

DNA contains the instructions for a cell's structure and function. It is the blueprints for how the cell runs, reproduces, builds and repairs itself, and every other function necessary for cell life.
