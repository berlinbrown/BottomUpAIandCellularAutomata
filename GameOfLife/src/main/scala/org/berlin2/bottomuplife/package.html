# Color and smoothness of the seeds - grey and round or white and wrinkled
# Color of the cotyledons (part of the embryo within the seed) - yellow or green
# Color of the flowers - white or violet
# Shape of the pods - full or constricted
# Color of unripe pods - yellow or green
# Position of flowers and pods on the stems
# Height of the plants - short or tall

============

Because, in order to show-up, a dominant trait needs only one trait unit from one of the parents, and the recessive one needs two, from both parents, in order to prevail, that is the reason why the ratio between occurrences of dominant traits and recessive traits is 3:1. The same explanation applies to the shape traits.

In the pollination process the offsprings get one trait unit (gene) from every parent;
 in the case of color the possible combinations are gY Yg YY gg. 

Possible traits from both parents.

 Notes:
================================

Radiation destroys units of protienunit.

each cellwall_proteinchemicalelementgridunit has a bond level/strength...
  ability to withstand --- radiationprotection_level
    if radiationprotection_level < 10% then , destroyed...
    
    ....
    
    Flagellen requires energy level...
    
    
    protein sytnehis only creates protein units, adds to ...
    
-------


A cell has energy.

What is the function of the cell wall??

The cell wall will protect the cell from radiation.

If raditation too high, cell dies.

  * ProteinGridUnit Configuration determines raditation protection, chemical reaction.
  * The configuration of the ProteinGridUnit determines protection radiotion level.
  
  FUNCTION may be inhibited.

My flagge protein only has one function, move in water.

 -- if no flaggea proteins then you can't move.

---------------------------------


Different cell levels.

1. Cell wall and flagella level

2. Protein, amino acid, Chemical level <---- what is in this level????
   What is in this level:  chemicals need to maintain the existence of this
                          property.

   Chemical Reaction between radiation of the sun and the protein on this cell
   
   -- Configuration -- proximity...takes energy...no energy force, dead...
   
      can a protein grid die??  no???  But more energy to do its job???

ProteinEnergySynthesisLevel.

Proteins are the "cellular machinery"; they are constantly being synthesized, 
and play many essential structural and enzymatic roles within the cell.

--- HOW DOES A CELL DIE? protein sythensis is interrupted.

seasons --- more radiaton 

What should the DNA control?

size --- how much protein is created.

grid is actually chemicals, proteins.  we can't change the chemical elements.

should we be able to change the properties of the proteins?

More cell wall protein, less energy to perform that function.

Sun can damage the DNA...

Why is water needed for life?  movement...

Viruses can inhibit growth!!!!

Bacteria CELL:
DNA FOR PROTEIN SYTHNSEISIS

During protein sythnesis, you are creating the cells.

-- Protein level for cell wall is 100, interaction with sun level
  ... is 95 on each interation.
  ... energy level...
  
-- Movement thing causes it to move
=----

DNA is the blueprint...always static...

What is an amino acid?

What is a mocelule?


a protein is a generic term for anything that is made of amino acids

Protein synthesis

-- structural support

Protein synthesis uses about 75 percent of a cell’s energy;

hey define the codons and determine which amino acids are used to construct proteins

-- proteins make up the machinery

Initiatino, - d polypeptide is released from the ribosome.

What is protein synthesis? -- process in which cells build proteins?

There are several hundred distinct human cell types [1], [2][3]. 
There are between 50 and 75 trillion cells in the human body.

What is a protein?  What is an amino acide?


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein

20 standard amino acids; 

-- Cell wall
-- Chromosome
-- Plasma membrane
-- Fibrils
-- Ribosomes

Protein

The most elaborate viruses are the bacteriophages
Viruses also carry genes for making proteins that are never incorporated into the 
virus particle and are found only in infected cells. These viral proteins are 
called non-structural proteins; they include factors required for the replication 
of the viral genome and the production of the virus particle.

DNA contains the instructions for a cell's structure and function. It is the blueprints for how the cell runs, reproduces, builds and repairs itself, and every other function necessary for cell life.
